# functional_oop_programming
A package to compare different styles (cultures) of programming including Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional programming (FP)
This Python code compares Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional programming (FP) style/culture for a small problem. Here, the code asks for user entry to select one of the three experts (Alex, Mark, and Richard). Then it asks for another user entry to compute different functions like finding a prime number, factorial, and Fibonacci series. Then, the code will print out the specifications of each expert (name, company, position, and discipline) and provides the computation output. The code is started with OOP style and then FP. It has been tried to convert the OOP to FP style. 

Contribution are welcome to include other examples. Converting the codes to other programming languages are also welcome.
